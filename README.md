# Battleship in the OOP way

## The story

**Battleship** is a guessing game for two players (or a player VS computer). 
It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) are marked. The locations of the fleet are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet. 
It was invented by Emily and Maggie Laskey in 1915 and later published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic board game by Milton Bradley in 1967. The game has spawned electronic versions, video games, smart device apps and a film.
